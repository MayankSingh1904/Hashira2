This project is a **7-day meal combo planner** that generates daily meal combinations (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) based on a fixed master menu of food items. The combos are carefully designed to meet specific calorie requirements (between 500 and 800 calories) and provide a balanced taste profile by mixing spicy, savory, and sweet flavors. When a user selects a starting day of the week and clicks a button, the app fetches a unique weekly plan from the backend server, ensuring that meal combinations do not repeat too often and meet popularity and taste criteria.

The frontend presents this plan in a clear, user-friendly layout, showing each dayâ€™s meal combos along with detailed nutritional info, taste summaries, and reasoning behind each choice. This allows users to easily view and follow a varied, calorie-conscious meal plan for an entire week without needing any database or complex setup, making the project a simple yet effective example of combining backend logic with interactive frontend UI.
